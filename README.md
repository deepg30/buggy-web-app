# TechGear Catalog - Buggy Web App üêõ

A product catalog web application intentionally designed with production-level bugs for debugging and learning purposes.

## Overview

This is a single-page product catalog application that displays electronics and gadgets. While the UI functions and looks professional, it contains various bugs that appear in the browser console - simulating real-world debugging scenarios.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Product catalog with filtering and sorting
- ‚úÖ Shopping cart functionality
- ‚úÖ Responsive design
- ‚úÖ Modal dialogs
- ‚úÖ Local storage integration
- üêõ **Intentional bugs for learning purposes**

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Simple HTTP Server (Python)

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /Users/deepg/Projects/buggy-web

# Start a local server
python3 -m http.server 8080

# Or use the npm script
npm start
```

### Option 2: Live Server (VS Code Extension)

1. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
2. Right-click on `index.html`
3. Select "Open with Live Server"

### Option 3: Direct File Opening

Simply open `index.html` in your browser (some features may be limited due to CORS).

## Bugs Included üêõ

This application contains **21 intentional bugs** that will appear in the console:

### JavaScript Errors

1. **Null Reference Error** - Accessing non-existent DOM elements
2. **Undefined Function Calls** - Calling functions that don't exist
3. **API Simulation Failures** - Random network timeout errors
4. **Undefined Property Access** - Accessing properties on undefined objects
5. **Memory Leaks** - Event listeners without proper cleanup
6. **XSS Vulnerability Simulation** - Unsafe string concatenation
7. **Missing Debouncing** - Excessive filter function calls
8. **Global Error Handling Issues** - Interfering with debugging
9. **URL Update Failures** - Calling non-existent routing functions
10. **Analytics Tracking Errors** - Undefined analytics objects

### Performance Issues

11. **Inefficient Search** - Expensive operations without optimization
12. **Scroll Event Spam** - Unthrottled scroll listeners
13. **Wasteful Computations** - Unnecessary calculations
14. **Timeout Management** - Improper cleanup of timeouts

### Best Practice Violations

15. **Global Namespace Pollution** - Variables in global scope
16. **Improper Geolocation Access** - Wrong API usage
17. **Payment Processing Simulation** - Random failure scenarios
18. **Storage Access Issues** - LocalStorage error handling
19. **Navigation Failures** - Router dependency issues
20. **Focus Management** - Accessibility issues in modals
21. **Resource Loading** - Missing dependency handling

## User Experience

## Learning Objectives

This project helps developers practice:

1. **Console Debugging** - Reading and understanding error messages
2. **Error Handling** - Implementing proper try-catch blocks
3. **Performance Optimization** - Identifying and fixing performance issues
4. **Best Practices** - Recognizing and correcting code smells
5. **Production Debugging** - Real-world bug scenarios

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup
- **CSS3** - Modern styling with Grid and Flexbox
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - ES6+ features
- **Font Awesome** - Icons
- **Local Storage** - Data persistence

## Browser Console

Open your browser's developer tools (F12) and check the Console tab to see the various error messages and warnings generated by this application.
